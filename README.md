# Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Robot Position Control


The complexity of autonomous vehicles challenges traditional control systems making parameter tuning difficult. This has prompted exploration of alternative approaches. This project addresses wheeled mobile robot position control using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Conducting the learning process in simulation reduces risks to actual robots and eliminates the need for explicit knowledge of the systemâ€™s dynamic model. The authors have implemented and refined the RL algorithm, and analyzed the results. They design a model that interacts with the environment, using Q-learning to reach a destination place avoiding the obstacles.
