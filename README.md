# Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Robot Position Control


The complexity of autonomous vehicles challenges traditional control systems making parameter tuning difficult. This has prompted exploration of alternative approaches. This project addresses wheeled mobile robot position control using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Conducting the learning process in simulation reduces risks to actual robots and eliminates the need for explicit knowledge of the systemâ€™s dynamic model. The authors have implemented and refined the RL algorithm, and analyzed the results. They design a model that interacts with the environment, using Q-learning to reach a destination place avoiding the obstacles.

Find here all the related python code files, complete term paper with its latex source file as per NerIPS guidelines, ppt with latex zip file. 
To see the trained trained robot in pygame simulator, download the destination, obstacles and robot rover images rom here then download the q_table-10000000.pkl file which is the Q table of the robot which is made after training the robot for 1 crore episodes. Then run the main.py program.

Videos of untrained robot as well as trained robot simulation with 1 and 2 obstacles is given. The robot works fine with even more number of obstacles, chnage the number of obstacles in the main program and run it.
